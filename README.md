# 📈 Data Analysis Assignment – Xuefei Wang

This project presents a comprehensive data analysis of an anonymous dataset as part of an individual academic assignment. It explores the impact of demographic, behavioral, and attitudinal factors on a binary target variable through exploratory analysis, hypothesis testing, and machine learning modeling.

## 📌 Objectives

- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand feature distributions  
- Test hypotheses about factors influencing the target variable  
- Apply classification models to predict binary outcomes  
- Evaluate and compare model performance using key metrics
